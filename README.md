##  Project Overview  

This project builds a demand forecasting system using machine learning models such as XGBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The model predicts product demand based on historical sales data, price fluctuations, and store performance.

✔ End-to-End Pipeline from EDA → Model Training → Deployment
✔ Deployed on AWS SageMaker for scalable real-time inference
✔ Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions


### 🔹 Why Demand Forecasting?  
 **Reduces inventory costs** by minimizing overstock and shortages  
 **Improves decision-making** for procurement and logistics  
 **Enhances customer satisfaction** with better product availability
 
 
### Dataset Details
The dataset contains historical sales data with the following features:

** Column	Description
** record_ID	Unique record identifier
** week	Sales week (timestamp)
**store_id	Store identifier
**sku_id	Stock Keeping Unit (Product ID)
**total_price	Total revenue generated
** base_price	Product base price
**is_featured_sku	Whether the product was promoted
**is_display_sku	Whether the product was displayed prominently
**units_sold	Target Variable - Number of units sold
**year, month, week_num, quarter, day_of_week	Extracted time features
📌 Source: The dataset is stored in data/ and processed before training.



### 🔹 Key Features  
 **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering** (date-based & categorical features)  
 **ML Model Training & Evaluation** (XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  
 **AWS SageMaker Deployment** (for scalable predictions)  
 **Automated CI/CD Pipeline** (GitHub Actions for continuous deployment)

##  Model Performance Evaluation  

| Model               	 	| MAE       	| MSE        | R²        |
|----------------------|--------------------|------------|-----------|
| **XGBoost**         		| 0.3738 	 	| 0.2518     | **0.7462**|
| **Random Forest**   		| 0.3755        | 0.2721     | 0.7258    |
| **Gradient Boosting** 	| 0.5735        | 0.5554     | 0.4403    |

 **XGBoost performed the best** and was selected for deployment.

##  Step-by-Step Guide to Running the Project  

### 1️ Clone the Repository  
```
git clone https://github.com/himanshu-dandle/demand-forecasting.git
cd Demand_Forecasting_Project


2️ Set Up Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies

python -m venv forecasting_env
source forecasting_env/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
forecasting_env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️ configure AWS Credentials
Create a .env file in the project root (DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE).
	SAGEMAKER_BUCKET=demand-forecasting-bucket-us-east-1
	SAGEMAKER_ROLE=arn:aws:iam::060795905003:role/service-role/AmazonSageMaker-ExecutionRole-XXXXX

4️ Train the Model
	jupyter notebook notebooks/04_model_training.ipynb
	
5️ Deploy the Model to AWS SageMaker
	jupyter notebook notebooks/05_deployment_testing.ipynb

 Making Predictions with the Deployed Model
Once the model is deployed, send real-time inference requests:

import boto3
import json

runtime = boto3.client("sagemaker-runtime")

ENDPOINT_NAME = "xgboost-demand-forecasting-endpoint"

test_input = json.dumps({"instances": [[5.2, 3.1, 1.4, 0.2]]})  # Modify as needed

response = runtime.invoke_endpoint(
    EndpointName=ENDPOINT_NAME,
    ContentType="application/json",
    Body=test_input
)

result = json.loads(response["Body"].read().decode())
print("Prediction:", result)

 CI/CD Workflow (GitHub Actions)
This project includes automated model deployment via GitHub Actions.

 Workflow File: .github/workflows/deploy.yml
 Triggers: Runs on every push to main branch

🔄 What Happens in CI/CD?
Checks out the latest code from GitHub
Installs dependencies inside a virtual environment
Deploys the trained model to AWS SageMaker
Runs inference tests to verify deployment


Environment Variables & Secrets
This project uses GitHub Secrets for secure access to AWS credentials:

Secret Name	Description
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID		AWS Access Key for authentication
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY	AWS Secret Key for authentication
SAGEMAKER_BUCKET		S3 bucket name for storing model files
SAGEMAKER_ROLE			AWS IAM Role for SageMaker execution
📌 To set up GitHub Secrets:

Go to your GitHub repo → "Settings" → "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"
Add the required secrets (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, etc.)


Future Enhancements
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters for better 
Feature Engineering Improvements (Lags, Moving Averages)
Deep Learning Models: Implement LSTMs or Transformers for time series forecasting
External Data Sources: Include macroeconomic indicators for better predictions
Deploy as API: Use FastAPI or Flask for real-time predictions
Scale Deployment with AWS Lambda

🛠 Troubleshooting Guide
🚨 Issue: Deployment fails with ModelError (415) - application/json is not an accepted ContentType
✅ Fix: Update test_inference.py to use "text/csv" instead of "application/json".

🚨 Issue: FileNotFoundError: models/xgboost_model.pkl not found in CI/CD
✅ Fix: Either commit the .pkl file or upload it to S3 before deployment.

🚨 Issue: Model is InService, but inference fails
✅ Fix: Check AWS CloudWatch Logs for error details.
